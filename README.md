# Task-Manager
Task Manager is a web app that allows users to add and delete tasks. It also allows assigning a user to a task and a status of completion. The status of a task can be updated. The app is synced with data in Airtable, such that all users view the same task data.

# Running the app

Once you have cloned the repository and navigated to the Task-Manager folder, run
`npm install`. Then, run the app by entering `npm run start`.
